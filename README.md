Story Personalization System
====

MyTale is a simple, easy-to-use interface where users can **explore**, 
**personalize**, and **create** social stories, a tool developed by Carol Gray
to help austistic children improve communication and self-care skills. From the 
MyTale search page, users can choose a social story that fits their needs with 
the help of tags and filters geared toward specific audiences and then 
personalize that story. Users can also upload stories that they have created or 
edited and want others to see. Our Story Editor gives the user the tools to 
easily personalize stories to their requirements, ranging from the color scheme 
to the content in the story. If the user cannot find a story of their liking, 
they can simply create their own. MyTale reinvents the way social stories are 
delivered, providing a comfortable and streamlined user experience.
